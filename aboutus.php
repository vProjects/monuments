							<p>Here at Eternal Legacy we know that nothing has been done to enhance headstones in hundreds of years. Birth and death date, name of the deceased, and maybe a picture.  It’s about time we re-imagined the headstone which is why we are introducing the Living Monument. This is a treated aluminum QR code designed to adhere to all of the most common headstone materials.
A quick scan of the code will bring you to a personalized memorial page set up by the family for the deceased. As many pictures as you’d like to add, a biography, any tribute videos for your loved one all right there on a simple two by two inch square.
</p>
<p>Our Promise to You</p>
<p>Each Living Monument scan comes with a lifetime warranty and no monthly or yearly
subscription fees. We understand the evolving nature of the internet and know that it will change in the next 100 years. Which is why every single one of our scans can be remotely changed once they are engraved.
</p>
